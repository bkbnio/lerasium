This section is intended to get users up and running with a lerasium application as quickly as possible.  It 
will go over setting up a simple domain, generating the service code, and running the application against a
simple local environment.

If you would like an example that runs out of the box, you can clone the Lerasium repository, and build 
the `playground` module.  For more details on running the playground, see the [playground](playground.md) doc.

To use lerasium in a new project, see the [quickstart](quickstart.md) doc.
